# Bike Sharing Analysis

### Tableau - Module14

## Overview of Analysis
In this challenge I looked at the CitiBike data from New York City. I looked at usage by gender, by time, by user type and combinations of those measures. These visualization would help our investors understand how a bike sharing company might fare in Iowa.

From the Checkout line graphs, the most common ride usage length appears to be around 5 to 30 minutes. Both male & female users show that same tendancy.

From the User Type graphs, the most popular days for bike usage for subscribers is Thursday and Friday. For Customers, the most popluar days are Saturday and Sunday, followed by Friday. Overall the most popular day is Thursday.

From the Gender graphs, the data shows that more males than females use the bikes, but there is little difference in usage hours or times.

From the Peak Usage graphs, the data shows that on weekdays subscribers are using the bikes for commuting to and from work. It shows that the most popular time for bike usage is Thursday evening between 5 PM and 7 PM.


## Summary

In summary, the bike sharing business in New York City shows that the best targets for business are commuters within a 20 minute bike ride or their offices. A secondary target would be tourists or non-commuters. In addition to the visualizations already done, I would look at the number of rentals from each station to see the most commonly used. I would also look at the bike usage per bike.
